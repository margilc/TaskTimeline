 # Obsidian Plugin Refactoring Plan

## 🏗️ **PROJECT ARCHITECTURE AND GUIDELINES**

### **Three-Component Architecture:**
- **UI Components** - Pure presentation layer that listens to state changes
- **AppStateManager** - Integrated state management, vault events, and business logic orchestration
- **Business Logic Functions** - Pure functions in `src/core/update/` directory

### **Convention-Based Event System:**
- UI Components: Listen to `update_<NAME>_done` events and redraw via `appStateManager.getState()`
- AppStateManager: Listens to vault events and internal pending events, calls business logic, emits done events
- Business Logic Functions: Pure functions that accept app and state, return new state

### **Code Quality Standards:**
- Absolutely minimal files with no unnecessary code
- Maximum 3 lines of comments per file
- Zero references to legacy code
- Follow `update_<NAME>_pending/done` convention
- Single responsibility per file

### **Current Architecture:**
```

├── core/                           # Core application logic
│   ├── AppStateManager.ts          # State + events + vault listening + persistence
│   ├── update/                     # Business logic functions

└── main.ts                         # Plugin entry point
```

### **Testing Strategy:**
- Test only utility functions with meaningful logic complexity
- No UI component testing (components should be simple enough)
- No AppStateManager testing (requires excessive mocking)
- Focus on performance and correctness testing for core algorithms
- Jest test runner with comprehensive coverage for layout algorithms

### **Development Commands:**
- `npm run dev` - Build and watch for changes (auto-copies to test vault)
- `npm run test` - Run Jest tests
- `npm run graph:deps` - Generate dependency graph visualization
